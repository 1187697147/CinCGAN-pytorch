This repository is a PyTorch version of the paper **"Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution using Cycle-in-Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks"** from **CVPRW 2018**.


For super-resolution setting I refer to [EDSR (PyTorch)](https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch) (you can download pretrained EDSR from here)

This version is not good looking yet. 
It will be updated later..

## Train

800 training (~800) & 100 validation images (801~900)
* Pretrain EDSR network.
